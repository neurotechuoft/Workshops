There's actually another way of breaking down functions with *polynomials* called the Taylor Series (AP / first year calc anyone?)

The brain often *oscillates* at frequencies that tells us a lot about the brain, but polynomials can't give us this information! Neither do they tell us much about oscillations in general.
