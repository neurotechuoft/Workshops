# Intro to Neurotech: 2018-2019
Make artwork representing your brain with the Muse EEG headband, and learn about neurotech in the process!

## Format
Lecturing is boring! Instead, we want pairs of students to work towards the final brain-art project. Pairs will go through each week's notebook, and fill in the code and run it. If it doesn't work, no worries! We'll have mentors floating around to help pairs debug or understand concepts better.

This is going to be a cross of our workshops from 2017-2018 and our initial Prezi workshops, but with less emphasis on hardware and more emphasis on sofware techniques and the brain.

**NOTE**: This course is kind of crazy! We're teaching a lot of stuff, and really advanced stuff ... so if you feel a bit lost, don't worry! Just come to HackTernoons or office hours and we'll learn it together :)

**NOTE 2**: We're trying to cram a lot of crazy things in the span of a semester! This means we really have to rely on readings to prep you for each week's workshop. **Please make sure to do the mandatory readings** and any **mandatory prep noted** before you come to the workshop, as it will make understanding the material infinitely easier :)
